    <h2>Beaver F1 Leauge Rules 2025</h2>
    <p>This is the official rule sheet for the BF1 2025 Season. This is a living document and subject to change (with prior notice). Credit for many of the rules to @geolessel on <a href="https://github.com/geolessel/fantasy-f1-rules">Github.</a></p>

    <h3>Teams</h3>
    <p>Teams have exactly 2 drivers. Each driver can only be on one team at a time. Drivers can be traded or sold in exchange for a leftover driver by posting in the corresponding Discord channel to initiate the trade.</p>
    <h3>Driver Draft (Auction)</h3>
    <p>Teams are set in the beginning of the season through an auction-style driver draft. Each team/player begins the season with 100 draft points. Drivers are auctioned over Discord, in order of their ranking in the previous year's driver championship (e.g. the winner is first, then 2nd place, and so on). Bidding starts at 10 points per driver, and continues until everyone balks (or mathematically cannot continue bidding). The auction continues until each team has 2 drivers. If the driver list is exhausted while players have only 1 driver, the auction will cycle back to any unsigned drivers in order.</p>
    <h3>Points</h3>
    <p>Scoring is carried out in 3 categories: Championship, Laps, and Delta. Championship points are equal to double that of the scored FIA points for each driver (First would be 50, then 36, and so on). Lap points are given 1 to 1 for laps completed, to discourage DNFs. Delta points <i>(previously "position points")</i> are equal to the number of places gained or lost, equal to <i>starting position - finishing position</i>.</p>
    <h3>Roster Changes</h3>
    At any point during the season changes to rosters can be made. Each driver is valuated at a calculated number of draft points (from the auction) equal to 21 minus their current standing in the championship. This is updated weekly. Note trading of unsigned drivers can not occur until after Bahrain, but trades between teams can occur at any time outside of the trade lock.
    <h4>>The Trade Lock</h4>
    <p>Trades and purchases of drivers can not occur after FP1 until after the Grand Prix is completed. (See Parc Ferme Below)</p>
    <h4><b>>The Pit Stop Rule (new for 2025)</b></h4>
    <p>All teams/players are required to make at least 1 trade during the 2025 season. That is, you can not keep the same 2 drivers throughout the entire year. This trade can occur with the unsigned drivers pool, or with other players. Note that all regular rules for trades apply; this is intentionally done to encourage strategizing and scheming among players.</p>
    <h3>Parc Ferme</h3>
    <p>Roster changes must be made before FP1 on each race week. Exceptions can be reviewed ad-hoc (for example if FP1 is rained out). If a driver is unable to compete in a race for any reason (injury, etc) the reserve driver will be scored instead. If a driver is disqualified <i>during</i> a race they will only be scored on points.</p>
